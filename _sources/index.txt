Genecology Project Webapp API
=============================

The Genecology Project web app provides a dynamic interface for exploring historical relationships and the specific textual evidence used to substantiate those relationships, including text annotations, topic models, and social influence models. The webapp consumes a variety of RESTful services in the Digital HPS research framework at ASU.

This documentation is a work in progress, and is updated regularly. The primary focus has been on providing API documentation of the data model. Future revisions will include use-case descriptions and walk-throughs for the administrative interface. For more information, contact `Erick Peirson <https://github.com/erickpeirson>`_.
