Genecology Project Webapp
=========================

The Genecology Project web app provides a dynamic interface for exploring historical 
relationships and the specific textual evidence used to substantiate those relationships, 
including text annotations, topic models, and social influence models. The webapp is
built using Django 1.6, and consumes a variety of RESTful services in the Digital HPS 
research framework at ASU.
